Predicting the popularity of Reddit posts -

As the title of the project suggests, the objective of this project is to predict the popularity of Reddit posts. The data can be found in: https://files.pushshift.io/reddit/submissions/

As for methodology, There are three algorithms are included in a thoroughly conducted comparative study. Similarly, the choice of evaluation metrics and various plots and reports to show the comparisons is yours.

1. Train/Test/Validation split: Using the data corresponding to the year 2019 (the first 8 months only). First 4 months are used for training, the next 2 months for test and the next 2 months for validation

2. Size: The dataset is very big, but you don't need all the features. Filtering out some unnecessary features will reduce the size. You can also use moderate down-sampling to reduce the size

3. Class Label: The class label is given in the field named “score”. This looks like a regression problem.
